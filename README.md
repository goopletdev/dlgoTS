# dlgoTS
TypeScript implementation of 'Deep Learning and the Game of Go'.

I'm following along the [Manning Publications book by Max Pumperla and Kevin Fergusen](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go), and trying to learn TypeScript along the way by mirroring their Python code in TS.

All of the code from the book is available on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go).
